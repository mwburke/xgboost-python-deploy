# XGBoost Python Deployment

This package allows users to take their XGBoost models they developed in python, and package them in a way that they can deploy the model in production using only pure python.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** currently, this package seems to be working correctly for regression problems, but is having consistent mismatches between the original and production versions of the models using the `binary:logistic` objective. This is being raised as an issue directly with XGBoost to figure out how the tree leaf values are being generated in this case. For a more detailed look into this issue, please check out the `debug.py` file. Interestingly enough, the AUROC from original and production models are equal on the same data, which indicates that the transformations performed on both maintain overall prediction ordering but causes errors in terms of true magnitude.

## Installation

You can install this from pip using `pip install pip install xgboost-deploy-python`. The current version is 0.0.1.

It was tested on python 3.6 and and XGBoost 0.81.

## Deployment Process

The typical way of moving models to production is by using the `pickle` library to export the model file, and then loading it into the container or server that will make the predictions using `pickle` again. Both the training and deployment environments require the same package and versions of those packages instsalled for this process to work correctly.

This package follows a similar process for deployment, except that it relies only on a single JSON file, and the pure python code that makes predictions, removing the dependencies of `XGBoost` and `pickle` in deployment.

Below we will step through how to use this package to take an existing model and generate the file(s) needed for deploying your model. For a more detailed walk-through, please see `example.py`, which you can run locally to create your own files and view some potential steps for validating the consistency of your trained model vs the new production version.

### `fmap` Creation

In this step we use the `fmap` submodule to create a feature map file that the module uses to accurately generate the JSON files.

A `fmap` file format contains one line for each feature according to the following format: `<line_number> <feature_name> <feature_type>`

Some notes about the full file format:

* `line_number` values start at zero and increase incrementally.
* `feature_name` values **cannot** contain spaces in them or the file will truncate the feature names after the first space in the JSON model file
* `feature_type` options are as follows:
    - `q` for quantitative (or cintuous) variables
    - `int` for integer valued variables
    - `i` for binary variables, please note that this field does **not** allow null values and always expects either a 0 or a 1. Your predictor function may error and fail.

Here is an `fmap` file generated using the `example.py` file:

```
0 mean_radius q
1 mean_texture q
2 mean_perimeter q
3 mean_area q
4 mean_smoothness q
5 mean_compactness q
6 mean_concavity q
7 mean_concave_points q
8 mean_symmetry q
9 mean_fractal_dimension q
10 radius_error q
11 texture_error q
12 perimeter_error q
13 area_error q
14 smoothness_error q
15 compactness_error q
16 concavity_error q
17 concave_points_error q
18 symmetry_error q
19 fractal_dimension_error q
20 worst_radius int
21 worst_texture int
22 worst_perimeter int
23 worst_area int
24 worst_smoothness i
25 worst_compactness i
26 worst_concavity i
27 worst_concave_points q
28 worst_symmetry q
29 worst_fractal_dimension q
30 target i
```

You can either generate your `fmap` file using lists of feature names and types using the `generate_fmap` function or automatically from a `pandas` DataFrame using the `generate_fmap_from_pandas` which extracts column names and infers feature types.

### JSON Model Creation

The `XGBoost` package already contains a method to generate text representations of trained models in either text or JSON formats.

Once you have the `fmap` file created successfully and your model trained, you can generate the JSON model file directly using the following command:

```python
model.dump_model(fout='xgb_model.json', fmap='fmap_pandas.txt', dump_format='json')
```

This should generate a JSON file in your `fout` location specified that should have a list of JSON objects, each representing a tree in your model. Here's an example of a subset of one such file:

```json
[
  { "nodeid": 0, "depth": 0, "split": "worst_perimeter", "split_condition": 110, "yes": 1, "no": 2, "missing": 1, "children": [
    { "nodeid": 1, "depth": 1, "split": "worst_concave_points", "split_condition": 0.160299987, "yes": 3, "no": 4, "missing": 3, "children": [
      { "nodeid": 3, "depth": 2, "split": "worst_concave_points", "split_condition": 0.135049999, "yes": 7, "no": 8, "missing": 7, "children": [
        { "nodeid": 7, "leaf": 0.150075898 },
        { "nodeid": 8, "leaf": 0.0300908741 }
      ]},
      { "nodeid": 4, "depth": 2, "split": "mean_texture", "split_condition": 18.7449989, "yes": 9, "no": 10, "missing": 9, "children": [
        { "nodeid": 9, "leaf": -0.0510330871 },
        { "nodeid": 10, "leaf": -0.172740772 }
      ]}
    ]},
    { "nodeid": 2, "depth": 1, "split": "worst_texture", "split_condition": 20, "yes": 5, "no": 6, "missing": 5, "children": [
      { "nodeid": 5, "depth": 2, "split": "mean_concave_points", "split_condition": 0.0712649971, "yes": 11, "no": 12, "missing": 11, "children": [
        { "nodeid": 11, "leaf": 0.099997662 },
        { "nodeid": 12, "leaf": -0.142965034 }
      ]},
      { "nodeid": 6, "depth": 2, "split": "mean_concave_points", "split_condition": 0.0284200013, "yes": 13, "no": 14, "missing": 13, "children": [
        { "nodeid": 13, "leaf": -0.0510330871 },
        { "nodeid": 14, "leaf": -0.251898795 }
      ]}
    ]}
  ]},
  {...}
]
```

### Model Predictions

Once the JSON file has been created, you need to perform three more things in order to make predictions:

1. Store the base score value used in training your XGBoost model
2. Note whether your problem is a classification or regression problem.
    - Right now, this package has only been tested for the `reg:linear` and `binary:logistic` objectives which represent regression and classification respectively.
    - The only difference is that classification problems perform a sigmoid transformation on the margin values.
3. Load the JSON model file into a python list of dictionaries representing each model tree.

Once you have done that, you can create your production estimator:

```python
with open('xgb_model.json', 'r') as f:
    model_data = json.load(f)

pred_type = 'regression'
base_score = 0.5  # default value


estimator = ProdEstimator(model_data=model_data,
                          pred_type=pred_type,
                          base_score=base_score)
```

After that, all you have to do is format your input data into python dicts and pass them in individually to the estimator's `predict` function.

If you want more detailed info for validation purposes, there is a `get_leaf_values` function that can return either the leaf values or final nodes selected for each tree in the model for a given input.

## Performance

As mentioned at the top, the initial test results indicate that for regression problems, there is a 100% match in predictions between original and production versions of the models up to a 0.001 error tolerance.

As for speed, for 10 trees, the prediction for input with 30 features is 0.00005 seconds with 0.000008 seconds standard deviation.

Obviously as the number of trees grows, the speed should decrease linearly, but it should be simple to modify this to add in parallelized tree predictions if that becomes an issue.

If you are really looking for optimized deployment tools, I would check out the following compiler for ensemble decision tree models: https://github.com/dmlc/treelite
